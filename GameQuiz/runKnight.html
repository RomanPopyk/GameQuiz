        With unwavering courage, you make a bold decision to flee from the 
        encroaching bandits. Good thing that as a knight you had a horse with you.
        Behind you, the bandits struggle to keep pace, their efforts proving 
        futile against the swiftness of your escape. Grateful for your horse's 
        strength and agility, you race towards safety, leaving the bandits in
        the dust.
